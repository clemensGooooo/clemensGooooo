# About me

Hi, Iâ€™m @clemensGooooo aka cle.hack/Clemens.Gooooo.

I'm 17 years old, so still in something like German :school: high school.

I'm passionate about computer science, with a particular interest in hacking and cybersecurity.

#### What I already had done:
- Hacking/Cybersecurity :lock:, I learned lots of stuff on different hacking platforms. (THM, HTB, picoCTF, CryptoHack & others)
- Lots of CTF challenges, I love doing new CTF challenges and learning things on the way. I do this on the platforms above, additionally participated at Midnight Flag CTF, TAMUctf and the German CTFs below.
- Participated at some German CTF challenges (2x CSCG,DBH)
- Sometimes I reasearch some stuff, lol :v: (Investigate interesting vulns and more...)
- Worked with linux servers :computer: and Dockers :whale:, Containers, VMs -> Virtualisation
- Front-End, Back-End development with different languages... (Backend: FastAPI,Express.JS Frontend: React, Plain JS/HTML/CSS)
- AI with Python :snake: (tensorflow and some other stuff)
- Website and Applications in JavaScript and Python with CSS,HTML :page_with_curl: and Markdown
- Worked with Arduino :skull: and ESP-Family and coded in C++, made some projects
- Worked on my self designed app :clock9: (React Native, and Web App)
- Build different complex Electron apps with vite/react-ts, did some React (Made a task manager, which has more functions)
- Mobile development, worked with React-Native
- Made some games in Unity (2D mostly, easier)
- Docker, deployed some applications (Dockerfiles, CMD)
- Made some stuff with databases  :file_folder: (mostly NoSQL like MongoDB, but sometimes SQL like: PostgreSQL,MySQL and some InfluxDB for ESP) 
- I have been using Linux, since I was a kid
- Websites were my intro into the development stuff, I developed them all my free time

I think you get it ;)
